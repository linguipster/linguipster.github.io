            <h1>A list of my ever-growing coding plans/ideas</h1>
            <p>Doable in the near future: </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        Random Movie Picker with "heavy" / "non-heavy" category: Build own database with movies we own / want to watch and add parameters such as: Year of publication, Cast, Genre (the common ones). Then, also to be added: A binary heavy/non-heavy parameter: This value is rather unique to our / my interpretation of heavy so that's why I can't just use the already existing random movie pickers that have similar options. 
                        The idea would be that one could input certain constraints such as "I want the movie to be from the 90ies or later" and then also filter out the "heavy" one. [[This is of course mainly to practice OOP]]
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>Doable once I have more skills: </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        TeTra: Please add the pdf with the longer description (To Do). In short: ...
                    </li>

                </ul>
