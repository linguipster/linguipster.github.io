                        While I'm neither financially nor emotionally in any state to BUY LAND, I have to take a note of this too. Because you never know, y'know.

                        Because I have visited the same village / place for about 25 years, I do feel like the Intragna/Pila area is somewhat a second home, and I do know it quite well. Pretty sure I know exactly where this yellow house stands! Not my style. But mainly, not my budget! Almost 2 million. How well does coding pay again?

                        Prefurnished. Has been advertised for a while, I want to say, over 1.5 years? I wonder why (seriously)? Thinking I might be romanticizing the place. But what's life without romance? (Chill, probably)

                         This one is actually in Golino, not quite in Intragna itself, however the two villages are right next to each other (or, I should say, Colino is below Intragna, which is why we don't go there often: THE DAMNED STAIRS ALL THE TIME). Actually, maybe Golino is part of Intragna. I do not know this.

                        I have never considered that there could be HOUSES to buy, for obvious reasons, but a girl can dream so let's still put them here so I won't forget.    </li>

                Description: A game that makes the user guess numbers until they manage to guess the correct one (random choice from a certain range).

                I solved this task as an exercise by an online platform that I use to learn more Python. It is called programmingexpert.io and I find it very useful in addition to uni.
