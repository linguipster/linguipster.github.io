                Of course, this is all entirely anecdotal. However, after having spoken about this to both
                neurodivergent and neurotypical friends, I am quite convinced that coding was made for us.

                I believe coding offers a unique set of requirements and rewards that match perfectly with the neurodivergent brain.
                While I'm speaking mainly from the ADHD perspective, I am assuming that autistic people would agree, too! (My twitter time line at least seems to agree.)
