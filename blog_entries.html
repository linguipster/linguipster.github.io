                Of course, this is all entirely anecdotal. However, after having spoken about this to both
                neurodivergent and neurotypical friends, I am quite convinced that coding was made for us.

                I believe coding offers a unique set of requirements and rewards that match perfectly with the neurodivergent brain.
                While I'm speaking mainly from the ADHD perspective, I am assuming that autistic people would be able to relate, too! (My twitter time line at least seems to agree.)
                <br>
                <br>
                What I believe renders programming so interesting and valuable to people with ADHD, at least from my experience, is its unique make up from two things that do not usually go together:
                rigid rules and creativity. People with adhd are great problem solvers, our brains jump to solutions and make connections that others maybe wouldn't (especially working under pressure, which is something that we are good at creating at for ourselves, but that's a different story).
                Fast and innovative problem solving is itself a form for creativity, and coding always allows for more than 1 way to get to the goal. Solving a programming task is finding one of the many proverbal ways that lead to Rome;
                one might be faster than the others, the next might be more elegant, the third more understandable to the next traveller. And while some might argue that there usually is a limited number of "right" ways to solve a task, "right" is not a requirement for functioning.
                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of programming, "functioning" means that your code returns to you / does with your data what you want it to do. This type of "feedback" —seeing your code work, getting output returned, or seeing the "OK" unittest message— is highly rewarding for any person, but especially for people whose dopamine reserve is not something to write home about.
                When I was studying German Literature and Linguistics as well as General Linguistics, the feedback that we received was both unreliable and delayed. «Unreliable» because not always would you get a feedback in the first place (other than passed/not passed) and «delayed» because —understandably— teachers and professors need time to correct and grade our papers, essays or exams.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is why I came to love coding so quickly. Its clear and rigid rules are just that, rules. Something that is clear (not necessarily to me, from the start, but once understood, rules are something we can take by their word, which I appreciate). It is then my responsibility to get to know these rules, see how they work together, find out what is and what is not possible. Then, however, within this given and unmovable framework, my brain is allowed to roam free in finding a solution to get from A to B (so long as time and space allow for it).
                From where I stand, these are perfect conditions to get started!
