This is my first go at a personal portfolio. For now I have added some random things as well, such as a blog entry, because I don't have many coding projects to show for yet and this is more about building the portfolio on a practical level. 

Current Problem is that the page shows 404 instead of... well, the pages I prepared? 

**Update**  After changing main.html to index.html --> now this README is shown when acessing the page?? Instead of index.html 

**Second Update** It ended up just working, tbh. So I guess it is mandatory to have index.html 

**Third Update** I will be curious to see if the updated portfolio (updated via pycharm, I mean) is, once pushed, updated here automatically after some time?
